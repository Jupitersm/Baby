Hello, 
Im Peter, since 2014 Im interested in cryptocurrencies and programming but life did not allow me to develop in this direction. 
A very years ago I noticed that money was disappearing from BTC wallets, that had not been used for years. After my investigations I found something that I had hidden because I didn't understand it.
